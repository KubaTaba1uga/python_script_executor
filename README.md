Python Script Orchestrator organize scripts and executes them.
In case of error or input requirement, execution is stopped until
user doesn't perform an action.

To order scripts add numbers preceded by `_` to their ends. If numbers are missing
scripts will be executed randomly.

Example:
	script_0.sh
	script_1.sh
